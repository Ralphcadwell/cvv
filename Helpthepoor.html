        <h3>Challange</h3>
        <p>The number of orphans and vulnerable children in the world in 2021 is estimated at 153 million, out of which 16.5 million children worldwide have lost their mother, father or both parents due to HIV / AIDS . Some of these children are left with their poor grandparents, some of the children are with mentally ill mothers, sleeping under the bridges, while others roam on streets, exposing them to vulnerable situations of either being sexual exploited at a young and tender age or being sold into child labor. Majority of these children are denied basic rights. <strong>About 1.7 million children</strong>have HIV infection. Each year, about 160,000 more children are infected and about 100,000 children die. Children in orphanage resident care face many difficulties such as poverty, poor physical health, attachment disorders, inadequate social skills, and mental health difficulties. Added to this is the loss of one or both parents, which is difficult for the children.</p>
